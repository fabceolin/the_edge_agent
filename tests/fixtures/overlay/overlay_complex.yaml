# YE.9 Test Fixture: Complex scenario with multiple operations
# Operations:
#   - Modify process_llm node (change model)
#   - Add new logging_node
#   - Delete validate_result node
#   - Modify edge process_llm->validate_result
#   - Add new edge
# Expected: 5 nodes (5 base - 1 deleted + 1 added), 7 edges (6 base + 1 added)

nodes:
  - name: process_llm
    with:
      model: gpt-4o
      temperature: 0.2

  - name: logging_node
    run: |
      import logging
      logging.info(f"State: {state}")
      return {}

  - name: validate_result
    __delete__: true

edges:
  - from: process_llm
    to: format_output
    # Skip validate_result since it's deleted

  - from: logging_node
    to: __end__
    condition:
      type: expression
      value: "state.get('debug', False)"
