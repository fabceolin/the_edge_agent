# The Edge Agent (TEA)

> TEA is a lightweight, LLM-agnostic state graph library for building AI agents on edge computing environments. It features declarative YAML-based workflows, neurosymbolic AI patterns (Prolog integration), checkpoint persistence, and parallel execution with fan-out/fan-in patterns. Polyglot implementation in Python and Rust.
