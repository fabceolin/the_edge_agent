# Implementation highlights:
# - Used RwLock<Option<String>> for last_checkpoint (matches existing tera/template_cache pattern)
# - All 4 checkpoint save locations in executor.rs properly wired
# - Return type change: Option<&str> -> Option<String> for RwLock clone semantics
# - 6 new integration tests in test_checkpoint.rs
