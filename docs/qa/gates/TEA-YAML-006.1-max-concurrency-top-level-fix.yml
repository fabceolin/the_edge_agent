# Implementation quality highlights
strengths:
  - "Minimal change principle: only 9 lines modified"
  - "Clear inline comments explain intent"
  - "Correct precedence logic (top-level > nested)"
  - "Backward compatible (nested syntax still works)"
  - "Safe implementation (existing validation prevents edge cases)"
  - "Excellent test quality (thread-safe, realistic scenarios)"
  - "Zero technical debt introduced"
  - "Actually pays down debt (fixes doc/code mismatch)"

# Review notes
notes: |
  This is a textbook example of a well-executed bug fix:

  1. **Problem**: Documentation showed top-level syntax, but code only read from nested parallel_config
  2. **Impact**: Users following docs had concurrency limits silently ignored
  3. **Solution**: Check top-level first, fall back to nested (9 line change)
  4. **Validation**: 2 comprehensive tests + 29 existing tests confirm no regressions
  5. **Quality**: Clean code, clear intent, zero debt, excellent tests

  The implementation demonstrates deep understanding of:
  - Backward compatibility requirements
  - Thread-safe testing patterns
  - Edge case handling (validation prevents invalid values)
  - Minimal change principle

  No changes required. Ready for production.
