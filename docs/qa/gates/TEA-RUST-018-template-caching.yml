notes:
  dependency_investigation: |
    The original benchmark referenced `set_secrets()` and `set_checkpoint_dir()`
    methods from TEA-RUST-016/017. These APIs are NOT in yaml.rs despite those
    stories being marked "Done".

    For TEA-RUST-018: No action required - Dev Agent correctly removed speculative
    API calls. Template caching works independently.

    Recommend: Investigate TEA-RUST-016/017 implementation status separately.
