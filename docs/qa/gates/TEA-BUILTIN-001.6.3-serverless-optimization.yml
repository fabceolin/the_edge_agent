story: "TEA-BUILTIN-001.6.3"
story_title: "Serverless Optimization"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 21 acceptance criteria addressed. 19 fully implemented, 2 have documented acceptable limitations (AC-16 cloud cleanup, AC-20 retry backoff). Implementation follows project patterns with clean protocol design, lazy initialization, and graceful degradation."
