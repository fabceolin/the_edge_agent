verdict: PASS

summary: |
  Implementation of three execution modes (sequential, parallel, graph) for
  multi-task workflows. Includes git worktree actions for parallel task
  isolation, configurable use_worktrees option, and LLM-based dependency
  analysis for graph mode.

notes: |
  High-quality implementation with clean architecture:
  - ExecutionMode enum with SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL, GRAPH values
  - ExecutionConfig dataclass with YAML parsing and runtime overrides
  - BaseExecutor ABC with factory pattern in ExecutionOrchestrator
  - ParallelExecutor supports both worktree-isolated and simple concurrent modes
  - GraphExecutor includes LLM dependency analysis with fallback to sequential
  - Comprehensive test coverage with async patterns tested correctly
