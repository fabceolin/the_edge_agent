# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No SQL injection vectors. Parameterized queries used for word text. Numeric-only embedding interpolation is safe."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "DuckDB VSS extension provides efficient vector similarity. 15.74 MB Parquet file appropriate for 10k words."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with DuckDbResult. Fallback logic handles edge cases gracefully."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code with module and function-level docs. Clean separation between EmbeddingSearch and GameDb."
