nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Tool name validation prevents path traversal (SEC-001). Registry rejects unregistered actions (SEC-003). Required parameters validated."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Parallel decomposition via rayon. Lazy regex compilation via OnceLock. Bounded loops via max_steps/max_depth."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling via TeaResult. max_steps prevents infinite ReAct loops. max_depth prevents infinite decomposition recursion."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented with rustdoc. Clear module structure. Reusable LLM call helper. Type-safe output structures."
