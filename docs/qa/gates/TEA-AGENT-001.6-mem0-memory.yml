nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Scope isolation enforced (user_id, session_id, agent_id). Bulk delete requires explicit delete_all=True flag. API keys via env vars, not logged."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lazy initialization prevents startup overhead. No blocking operations without async patterns where expected."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful fallback to native memory when Mem0 unavailable. Error handling with clear messages."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation between client wrapper and actions. Well-documented with docstrings and YAML examples."
