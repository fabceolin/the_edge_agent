nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: >-
      Template interpolation uses sandboxed Jinja2; credentials resolved from
      environment; Firestore typed API prevents injection; no sensitive data
      in error messages.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: >-
      Client caching per project; lazy initialization for serverless; batch
      API reduces round trips. Query offset is post-query which may be slow
      for large offsets (documented limitation).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: >-
      Thread-safe client initialization with Lock; comprehensive error handling
      with structured error codes; graceful handling when firebase-admin not
      installed.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: >-
      Clean separation between client factory and actions; dual namespace
      registration for backward compatibility; comprehensive docstrings with
      YAML examples.
