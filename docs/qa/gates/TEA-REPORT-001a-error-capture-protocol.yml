    status: PASS
    notes: "Privacy requirements fully addressed - path sanitization strips home directory and converts absolute paths to relative. No state data, env vars, or file contents captured."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error capture only occurs on error paths - zero runtime overhead for happy path. Stack trace limited to 50 frames."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Hook installation is idempotent, thread-safe global state management in both runtimes."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean module separation, comprehensive documentation, builder patterns for ergonomic API."
