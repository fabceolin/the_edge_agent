nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Query injection risk documented in CLAUDE.md security warning. Callback URLs validated for non-empty but not scheme-validated (appropriate for trusted YAML sources)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "APOC_AVAILABLE property queries DB on each access - acceptable for typical usage patterns. Cleanup iterates individually - acceptable for <100 triggers."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with consistent error dictionary format. Thread-safe via self._lock. Graceful degradation when APOC unavailable."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns. Google-style docstrings. Type hints. Follows project coding standards. TRIGGER_SELECTORS constant for supported types."
