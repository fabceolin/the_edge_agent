# Quality Gate: TEA-STREAM-001.4
schema: 1
story: "TEA-STREAM-001.4"
story_title: "YAML Integration"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 24 tests pass. YAML schema correctly parses streams config, validates producer/consumer relationships, and provides actionable error messages."

quality_assessment:
  code_quality:
    - Clean dataclass design for NodeStreamsConfig and StreamSettings
    - Comprehensive validation with actionable error messages
    - Proper separation of concerns between parsing and validation
    - Fail-fast validation order (platform, strategy, then config)
  test_coverage:
    unit_tests: 18
    integration_tests: 6
    p0_critical: 12
    p1_important: 9
    p2_edge_cases: 3
  implementation_notes:
    - streams.enabled defaults to false (opt-in feature)
    - Strategy validation prevents thread execution with streams
    - Interrupt validation prevents checkpointing on stream nodes
    - stream_mode validation ensures direct mode has single target

validation_rules_verified:
  - Consumer references non-existent producer raises error with fix suggestion
  - Multiple producers for same stream raises error
  - Thread strategy with streams raises error with fix
  - interrupt_before/after on stream node raises error
  - stream_mode direct with multiple targets raises error
  - Invalid stream_mode value raises error
