quality_assessment:
  code_quality:
    - E2E tests verify real pipe/FIFO operations
    - Example YAML files are syntactically valid and well-documented
    - Documentation includes troubleshooting guide with actionable fixes
    - Performance test validates throughput without deadlock

    p1_important: 6
    p2_edge_cases: 2
  documentation_artifacts:
    - streams.md: Complete reference with examples and troubleshooting
    - YAML_REFERENCE.md: Updated with Stream Channels section
    - stream_pipeline.yaml: Producer -> Transformer -> Consumer example
    - stream_broadcast.yaml: Broadcast to multiple consumers example
    - stream_hybrid.yaml: Hybrid state + stream with checkpointing example
    - examples/README.md: Updated with stream examples index

e2e_coverage:
  - Simple producer -> consumer (1000 records)
  - Streaming chain (producer -> transformer -> consumer)
  - Data integrity (complex JSON objects)
  - SIGPIPE handling (broken pipe graceful)
  - Broadcast to 3 consumers via FIFOs
  - FIFO cleanup after broadcast
  - Hybrid state + stream coexistence
  - Checkpoint on non-stream node
  - Error propagation (consumer crash)
  - Missing producer validation error
  - Stream + interrupt incompatibility error
  - 10MB throughput performance
