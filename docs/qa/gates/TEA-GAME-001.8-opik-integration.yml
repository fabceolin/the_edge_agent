nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Username in span metadata is expected for analytics. No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in payloads. Fire-and-forget semantics prevent timing attacks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fire-and-forget pattern prevents blocking game loop. serde_json serialization is efficient. Thread-local storage avoids lock contention in WASM context."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation implemented - game functions normally when Opik not configured. Error handling prevents span failures from affecting gameplay."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code with rustdoc examples. Clear separation of concerns between span construction and transmission. Follows established TEA-OBS-002 patterns."
