story_title: "Parallel Lua VM Isolation"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 10 acceptance criteria met. 77 tests pass (18 new isolation tests + 59 existing). Thread-local storage provides complete isolation with 0.13ms average overhead."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No new security surface. Each LuaRuntime maintains existing sandbox guarantees."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "0.13ms avg LuaRuntime creation (better than 1-5ms requirement). Max observed: 1.05ms."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Thread-local storage provides deterministic isolation. No mutex contention in parallel paths."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal code change (~20 lines in yaml_engine.py). Clean separation of concerns."
