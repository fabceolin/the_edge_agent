  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'State sanitization implemented for sensitive keys. Exporter errors silently caught to prevent information leakage.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Thread-local storage prevents contention. Exporters are non-blocking with error swallowing.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful degradation when tracing disabled. Exporter failures do not crash graph execution (P0 test).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Well-documented code with docstrings. Protocol-based exporter design allows easy extension.'
