# Quality Gate: TEA-STREAM-001.2
schema: 1
story: "TEA-STREAM-001.2"
story_title: "Pipe Executor Extension"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 29 tests pass. ProcessExecutor correctly wires pipes, handles async execution, and maintains backward compatibility."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

quality_assessment:
  code_quality:
    - Clean separation between standard and stream execution paths
    - Async subprocess management prevents deadlocks
    - TEA_STATE env var for small state, TEA_STATE_FILE for large state (>128KB)
    - exit_code properly captured in ParallelFlowResult

    unit_tests: 6
    integration_tests: 16
    e2e_tests: 2
    p0_critical: 11
    p1_important: 10
    p2_edge_cases: 3
  implementation_notes:
    - Backward compatible - execute() without stream_registry uses standard path
    - SIGPIPE handler installed before pipe creation
    - Proper fd inheritance handling for subprocess
