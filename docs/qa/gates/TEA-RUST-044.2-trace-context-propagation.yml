    status: PASS
    notes: "No sensitive data in trace context; UUIDs for identifiers; API key not stored in context"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "UUID generation is O(1); thread-local access minimal overhead; no runtime impact when disabled"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "RAII guards prevent context leaks; graceful fallback when no context; panic-safe SpanGuard"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Single-file implementation in observability.rs; clear interfaces; 16+ unit tests"
