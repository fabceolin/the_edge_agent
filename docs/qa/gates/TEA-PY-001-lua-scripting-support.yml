  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Sandbox removes os, io, debug, loadfile, dofile. Timeout via debug.sethook."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Negligible overhead from instruction counting hook (every 1000 ops)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Runtime recovers after timeout. Lock-based thread safety."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation between lua_runtime.py and yaml_engine.py. Comprehensive docstrings."
