  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Thread-safe implementation with proper locking. No hardcoded secrets. Keys are converted to strings preventing injection.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Uses monotonic time for TTL (immune to clock drift). O(1) operations for store/retrieve. Lock contention minimal for typical use.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling in all actions. Graceful fallbacks for missing keys, expired TTL, and backend failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean Protocol-based abstraction. Well-documented with docstrings and examples. Follows existing codebase patterns exactly.'
