  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error messages sanitized - no credential leakage, no vault URL exposure, no project ID in generic errors. Tests verify: test_aws_error_does_not_leak_credentials, test_azure_error_does_not_leak_vault_url, test_gcp_error_does_not_leak_project_id"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lazy loading implemented for all backends - secrets loaded on first access, not initialization. Caching verified in tests: test_azure_backend_caches_secrets, test_gcp_backend_caches_secrets"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All exception types properly caught and transformed to RuntimeError with actionable hints. ResourceNotFoundError, AccessDeniedException, NotFound handled gracefully."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns - each backend in separate module, factory pattern for instantiation, lazy imports prevent dependency issues. Good docstrings and type hints throughout."
