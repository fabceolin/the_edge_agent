    notes: "Relies on mlua sandboxing - recommend security audit before production"
  recommendations:

      - "Lua sandbox escape risk (relies on mlua implementation)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lua sandbox removes dangerous globals (os, io, loadfile, dofile, debug). Tests verify blocking of io.open and os.execute. Advisory: Audit mlua sandbox config before production."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "AtomicU32 for circuit breaker is lightweight. Consider LuaRuntime pooling for high-frequency usage. No benchmarks yet (P2 future work)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Circuit breaker prevents infinite loops. Error handling is comprehensive with TeaResult propagation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, well-documented module, proper separation of concerns. Follows established patterns from existing codebase."
