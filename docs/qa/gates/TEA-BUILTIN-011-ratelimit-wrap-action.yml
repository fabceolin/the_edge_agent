nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Rate limiting is defensive; no user input executed as code; no secrets handling"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "O(1) registry lookup; minimal lock contention; time.sleep() releases GIL"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Three-tier error handling; graceful degradation on limiter init failure"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns; comprehensive docstrings; follows TEA patterns"
