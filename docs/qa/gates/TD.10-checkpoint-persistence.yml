nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Pickle serialization has inherent code execution risk on untrusted files.
      Documented in CLAUDE.md as "only load from trusted sources". Acceptable
      for intended use case (developer-controlled checkpoint files).
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      File I/O overhead at interrupts is acceptable for normal usage.
      High-frequency interrupt scenarios may benefit from async writes (future).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Comprehensive error handling for file not found, corrupt files, and
      incompatible checkpoints. Consistent use of raise_exceptions flag.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Clean implementation following existing patterns. Versioned checkpoint
      format (v1.0) enables future evolution. Complete docstrings.

risk_assessment:
  primary_risk: Resume from wrong node position could cause unexpected behavior
  mitigation: |
    Tests TD.10-INT-002 and TD.10-INT-006 validate correct node positioning.
    Implementation verified to re-execute saved node as documented.
  rollback_strategy: Feature is additive; can be removed without breaking existing code
