nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No credential handling. SHA256 for cache keys prevents collisions. LTM handles storage security."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Deterministic key generation, probabilistic cleanup (5%), bounded cleanup limit. Known limitation: storage.hash reads full file into memory."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation on LTM failures tested in 3 scenarios. Actions never fail due to cache infrastructure."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns. Helper functions well-documented. Follows TEA action patterns."
