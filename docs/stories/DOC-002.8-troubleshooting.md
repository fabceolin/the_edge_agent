## Story

**As a** YAML agent developer encountering issues,
**I want** a dedicated troubleshooting guide,
**so that** I can quickly find solutions to common problems.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the Troubleshooting section in YAML_REFERENCE.md (~85 lines)
   **When** I extract it to `yaml-reference/troubleshooting.md`
   **Then** all content is preserved including:
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Debugging tips
   - FAQ items

2. **Given** the extracted troubleshooting.md
   **When** I read it
   **Then** it has:
   - Navigation links to related documents
   - Organized by error type/category
   - Search-friendly headings

3. **Given** the main YAML_REFERENCE.md
   **When** extraction is complete
   **Then** a summary with link replaces the full content
