## Story

**As a** documentation maintainer,
**I want** a well-organized directory structure for YAML reference documentation,
**so that** content can be modularly extracted into focused files.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** the docs/shared directory exists
   **When** I create the yaml-reference structure
   **Then** the following directories exist:
   - `docs/shared/yaml-reference/`
   - `docs/shared/yaml-reference/actions/`

2. **Given** the new directory structure
   **When** I create placeholder files
   **Then** each file has a consistent header template

3. **Given** the main YAML_REFERENCE.md
   **When** I add the new navigation section
   **Then** links to all sub-documents are present (even if files are empty)

## Dev Notes

### Standard Header Template

Each placeholder file should use this template:

```markdown
# [Section Title]

> **Parent document:** [YAML Reference](../YAML_REFERENCE.md)
> **Epic:** [DOC-002](../../stories/DOC-002-yaml-reference-modularization.md)

## Overview

[Brief description - to be filled in DOC-002.X]

---

## Table of Contents

[To be added when content is extracted]

---

## [Content sections to be added]

---

## See Also

- [Related Document 1](./related.md)
- [Related Document 2](./related.md)
```

### Navigation Section Template

Add to main YAML_REFERENCE.md after Table of Contents:

```markdown

## Testing

- Verify all placeholder files exist
- Verify all links in navigation section resolve (even to placeholder content)
- Verify directory structure matches target in epic

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] All 12 placeholder files created with standard headers
- [x] Navigation section added to main YAML_REFERENCE.md
- [x] All links in navigation section work

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-12-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation. All 12 placeholder files created with consistent structure following the template. The developer enhanced the template in places (e.g., actions/README.md includes a Category table, See Also sections use actual relevant links instead of generic placeholders). Navigation section in YAML_REFERENCE.md is clean and properly formatted with working relative links.

### Refactoring Performed

None required - implementation was clean.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (documentation only)
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows docs/shared convention
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Link verification completed
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 3 acceptance criteria verified

All requirements met - no improvements needed.

### Security Review

N/A - Documentation files only, no code execution.

### Performance Considerations

N/A - Static documentation files.

### Files Modified During Review

None.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/DOC-002.1-structure-setup.yml

### Recommended Status
