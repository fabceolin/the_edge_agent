# Simple Prolog Agent Example (Scryer Prolog)
#
# TEA-RELEASE-005.1: Scryer Prolog Spike
#
# This example demonstrates basic Prolog scripting with Scryer Prolog backend.
# Scryer is a pure-Rust Prolog implementation - no external dependencies needed!
#
# LIMITATIONS (Spike Findings):
# - No inline rule definitions (would require module loading)
# - No dynamic assertz/retract in queries
# - Simple state access and arithmetic works great
#
# Run with: cargo run --features scryer -- run examples/prolog/simple-prolog-agent-scryer.yaml --input '{"value": 21}'
#
# NOTE: Currently requires backend selection at compile time.
# Future work will add runtime backend switching.
