# Cross-Runtime Parity Test: Basic Arithmetic
# This agent should produce identical results in both Python and Rust TEA
name: prolog-parity-basic-arithmetic

nodes:
  - name: compute
    language: prolog
    run: "X is 10 + 20, Y is X * 2"

# Implicit flow: compute -> __end__

# Expected behavior:
# - Both runtimes execute X is 10 + 20, Y is X * 2
# - Query should succeed
# - No state output (variables bound but not returned)
