# Cross-Runtime Parity Test: Comparison Logic
# This agent tests logical comparisons work identically in Python and Rust TEA
name: prolog-parity-comparison-logic

nodes:
  - name: compare
    language: prolog
    run: "X = 5, Y = 10, X < Y"

edges:
  - from: __start__
    to: compare
  - from: compare
    to: __end__

# Expected behavior:
# - Both runtimes unify X=5, Y=10
# - Both evaluate X < Y (which succeeds)
# - Query succeeds with no output state
