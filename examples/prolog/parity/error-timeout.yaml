# Cross-Runtime Parity Test: Timeout Error
# Tests that both runtimes enforce timeout limits
# Expected: PrologTimeoutError (Python) / TeaError::PrologTimeout (Rust)
#
# NOTE: Both runtimes use SWI-Prolog's call_with_time_limit/2 predicate
# with default 30 second timeout. This test uses infinite recursion.
